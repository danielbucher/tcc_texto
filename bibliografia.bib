    abstract = {{It is now clear that as a result of this ubiquitous environment and the sheer volume of
their interaction with it, today's students  think and process information fundamentally 
differently from their predecessors. These differences go far further and deeper than most 
educators suspect or realize.  ” Different kinds of experiences lead to different brain 
structures,  ”  says Dr. Bruce D. Berry of Baylor College of Medicine.  As we shall see in 
the next installment, it is very likely that our students' brains have physically changed – 
and are different from ours – as a result of how they grew up.  But whether or not this is 
literally true, we can say with certainty that their  thinking patterns have changed. I will 
get to how they have changed in a minute. 
What should we call these  ” new” students of  today? Some refer to them as the N-[for
Net]-gen or D-[for digital]-gen. But the most useful designation I have found for them is
Digital Natives.  Our students today are all  ” native speakers” of  the digital language of 
computers, video games and the Internet.}},

abstract={Free/Libre/Open Source Software (FLOSS) communities have produced a large amount of valuable software that is directly or indirectly used daily by any person with access to a computer. The field of Software Engineering studies processes, mechanisms, tools, and frameworks for the development of software artifacts. Historically, however, most of Software Engineering research and education does not benefit from the large and rich source of data and experimental testbeds offered by FLOSS projects and their hundreds of millions of lines of working code. In this paper, we discuss how Software Engineering research and education can greatly benefit from the wealth of information available in the FLOSS ecosystem. We then evaluate how FLOSS has been used, up to now, by papers published in the Brazilian Symposium on Software Engineering. Finally, we present an agenda for the future, proposing concrete ways to exploit the synergies between research and education in Software Engineering and FLOSS projects.},
