	and governance practices is a traditional research problem. However,
	the extent to which consolidated results on this relationship remain
	valid for open source (OS) projects is an open research problem.
	An emerging body of literature contrasts the view of open source
	as an alternative to proprietary software and explains that there
	exists a continuum between closed and open source projects. This
	paper hypothesizes that as projects approach the OS end of the continuum,
	governance becomes less formal. in turn a less formal governance
	is hypothesized to require a higher-quality code as a means to facilitate
	coordination among developers by making the structure of code explicit
	and facilitate quality by removing the pressure of deadlines from
	contributors. However, a less formal governance is also hypothesized
	to increase development effort due to a more cumbersome coordination
	overhead. the verification of research hypotheses is based on empirical
	data from a sample of 75 major OS projects. Empirical evidence supports
	our hypotheses and suggests that software quality, mainly measured
	as coupling and inheritance, does not increase development effort,
	but represents an important managerial variable to implement the
	more open governance approach that characterizes OS projects which,
	in turn, increases development effort.}},

Several studies have validated that various metrics are useful indicators of maintenance effort in the procedural paradigm. However, software metrics have rarely been studied in the object-oriented paradigm. Very few metrics have been proposed to measure object-oriented systems, and the proposed ones have not been validated. This research concentrates on several object-oriented software metrics and the validation of these metrics with maintenance effort in two commercial systems. Statistical analyses of a prediction model incorporating 10 metrics were performed. In addition, a more compact model with fewer metrics is presented.}},

	This paper discusses these anomalies, describes a simple extension

%
Individual user-programmers decide whether to invest their own effort to develop
a software enhancement that will become a public good if so developed.
%
The effect of changing the population size of user-programmers is considered;
finite and asymptotic results are given. Welfare results are presented.
%
It is shown that whether development will increase when applications have a
modular structure depends on whether the developer base exceeds a critical size.
%
Potential explanations of several stylized facts are given, including why
certain useful programs don't get written.}

Several studies have validated that various metrics are useful indicators of maintenance effort in the procedural paradigm. However, software metrics have rarely been studied in the object oriented paradigm. Very few metrics have been proposed to measure object oriented systems, and the proposed ones have not been validated. This research concentrates on several object oriented software metrics and the validation of these metrics with maintenance effort in two commercial systems},

The classical maximum likelihood estimation procedure is reviewed and a new estimate minimum information theoretical criterion (AIC) estimate (MAICE) which is designed for the purpose of statistical identification is introduced. When there are several competing models the MAICE is defined by the model and the maximum likelihood estimates of the parameters which give the minimum of AIC defined by AIC = (-2)log-(maximum likelihood) + 2(number of independently adjusted parameters within the model). MAICE provides a versatile procedure for statistical model identification which is free from the ambiguities inherent in the application of conventional hypothesis testing procedure. The practical utility of MAICE in time series analysis is demonstrated with some numerical examples.}},

abstract = { When the analysis of real data indicates that normality assumptions are untenable, more flexible models that cope with the most prevalent deviations from normality can be adopted. In this context, the skew exponential power (SEP) distribution warrants special attention, because it encompasses distributions having both heavy tails and skewness, it allows likelihood inference, and it includes the normal model as a special case. This article concerns likelihood inference about the parameters of the SEP family. In particular, the information matrix of the maximum likelihood estimators (MLEs) is obtained and finite-sample properties of the estimators are investigated numerically. Special attention is given to the properties of the MLEs and likelihood ratio statistics when the data are drawn from a normal distribution, because this case is relevant for using the SEP distribution to test for normality. Application of the SEP distribution in robust estimation problems is considered for both independent and dependent data. Under moderate deviations from normality, estimators obtained under the SEP distribution are shown to outperform the normal-based estimators and to compete with robust estimators; furthermore, the SEP distribution offers the benefits of having a specified distribution, such as interpretable location and scale parameters under nonnormality. }

@article{clauset2007,
    abstract = {{Power-law distributions occur in many situations of scientific interest and have significant consequences for our understanding of natural and man-made phenomena. Unfortunately, the empirical detection and characterization of power laws is made difficult by the large fluctuations that occur in the tail of the distribution. In particular, standard methods such as least-squares fitting are known to produce systematically biased estimates of parameters for power-law distributions and should not be used in most circumstances. Here we describe statistical techniques for making accurate parameter estimates for power-law data, based on maximum likelihood methods and the Kolmogorov-Smirnov statistic. We also show how to tell whether the data follow a power-law distribution at all, defining quantitative measures that indicate when the power law is a reasonable fit to the data and when it is not. We demonstrate these methods by applying them to twenty-four real-world data sets from a range of different disciplines. Each of the data sets has been conjectured previously to follow a power-law distribution. In some cases we find these conjectures to be consistent with the data while in others the power law is ruled out.}},

While these families enjoy attractive formal properties from the probability viewpoint, a practical problem with their usage in applications is the possibility that the maximum likelihood estimate of the parameter which regulates skewness diverges. This situation has vanishing probability for increasing sample size, but for finite samples it occurs with non-negligible probability, and its occurrence has unpleasant effects on the inferential process. Methods for overcoming this problem have been put forward both in the classical and in the Bayesian formulation, but their applicability is restricted to simple situations. We formulate a proposal based on the idea of penalized likelihood, which has connections with some of the existing methods, but it applies more generally, including the multivariate case. "

	Abstract = {Several factors may impact the process of software maintenance and evolution of free software projects, including structural complexity and lack of control over its contributors. Structural complexity, an architectural concern, makes software projects more difficult to understand, and consequently more difficult to maintain and evolve. The contributors in a free software project exhibit different levels of participation in the project, and can be categorized as core and peripheral developers. This research aims at characterizing the changes made to the source code of 7 web server projects written in C with respect to the amount of structural complexity added or removed and the developer level of participation. We performed a field experiment and collected data from the version control repositories of those projects, recording Structural Complexity information for each change as well as identifying each change as performed by a core or a peripheral developer. We have found that core developers introduce less Structural Complexity than peripheral developers in general, and that in the case of complexity-reducing activities, core developers remove more Structural Complexity than peripheral developers. These results demonstrate the importance of having a stable and healthy core team to the sustainability of free software projects.},

 Abstract = {Recently, I became interested in a current debate over whether file size
distributions are best modelled by a power law distribution or a lognormal distribution.
In trying to learn enough about these distributions to settle the question, I found a rich
and long history, spanning many fields. Indeed, several recently proposed models from
the computer science community have antecedents in work from decades ago. Here,
I briefly survey some of this history, focusing on underlying generative models that
lead to these distributions. One finding is that lognormal and power law distributions
connect quite naturally, and hence, it is not surprising that lognormal distributions
have arisen as a possible alternative to power law distributions across many fields.},

Abstract = {In this paper, we introduce and analyze a new, dynamic generative user
model to explain the behavior of file size distributions. Our Recursive Forest File model
combines multiplicative models that generate lognormal distributions with recent work
on random graph models for the web. Unlike similar previous work, our Recursive
Forest File model allows new files to be created and old files to be deleted over time, and
our analysis covers problematic issues such as correlation among file sizes. Moreover,
our model allows natural variations where files that are copied or modified are more
likely to be copied or modified subsequently.
Previous empirical work suggests that file sizes tend to have a lognormal body but a
Pareto tail. The Recursive Forest File model explains this behavior, yielding a double
Pareto distribution, which has a Pareto tail but close to a lognormal body. We believe
the Recursive Forest model may be useful for describing other power law phenomena
in computer systems as well as other fields.

abstract={The statistical distributions of different software properties have been thoroughly studied in the past, including software size, complexity and the n. of defects. In the case of object-oriented systems, these distributions have been found to obey a power law, a common statistical distribution also found in many other fields. However, we have found that for some statistical properties, the behavior does not entirely follow a power law, but a mixture between a lognormal and a power law distribution. Our study is based on the Qualitas Corpus, a large compendium of diverse Java-based software projects. We have measured the Chidamber and Kemerer metrics suite for every file of every Java project in the corpus. Our results show that the range of high values for the different metrics follows a power law distribution, whereas the rest of the range follows a lognormal distribution. This is a pattern typical of so-called double Pareto distributions, also found in empirical studies for other software properties.},

abstract = "As firms increasingly sanction an open sourcing strategy, the question of which open source project to undertake remains tentative. The lack of established metrics makes it difficult to formulate such strategy. While many projects have been formed and created, only a few managed to remain active. With the majority of these projects failing, firms need a reliable set of criteria to assess what makes a project appealing not only to developers but also to visitors, users and commercial sponsors. In this paper, we develop a theoretical model to explore the contextual and causal factors of project attractiveness in inducing activities such as source code contribution, software maintenance, and usage. We test our model with data derived from more than 4000 projects spanning 4&#xa0;years. Our main findings include that projects’ set of conditions such as license restrictiveness and their available resources provide the context that directly influence the amount of work activities observed in the projects. It was also found that indirect and unintended contributions such as recommending software, despite of being non-technical, cannot be ignored for project activeness, diffusion and sustainability. Finally, our analysis provide evidence that higher attractiveness leads to more code-related activities with the downside of slowing down responsiveness to address projects’ tasks, such as the implementation of new features and bug fixes. Our model underscores the significance of the reinforcing effects of attractiveness and work activities in open source projects, giving us the opportunity to discuss strategies to manage common traps such as the liability of newness. We conclude by discussing the applicability of the research model to other user-led initiatives. "

doi = {10.1191/1471082X06st122oa}, 
abstract ={The Box-Cox t (BCT) distribution is presented as a model for a dependent
                variable Y exhibiting both skewness and leptokurtosis. The distribution is
                defined by a power transformation Y
                
                    v
                 having a shifted and scaled (truncated) t distribution with degrees
                of freedom parameter τ. The distribution has four parameters and is denoted
                by BCT(μ, σ,ν, τ). The parameters
                    μ, σ,ν and τ may be interpreted as
                relating to location (median), scale (centile-based coefficient of variation),
                skewness (power transformation to symmetry) and kurtosis (degrees of freedom),
                respectively. The generalized additive model for location, scale and shape (GAMLSS)
                is extended to allow each of the parameters of the distribution to be modelled as
                linear and/or non-linear parametric and/or smooth non-parametric functions
                of explanatory variables. A Fisher scoring algorithm is used to fit the model by
                maximizing a (penalized) likelihood. The first and expected second and cross
                derivatives of the likelihood with respect to μ,
                σ,ν and τ, required for the algorithm, are
                provided. The use of the BCT distribution is illustrated by two data applications.},

	Abstract = {As emphasized in other chapters of this book, useful results in empirical software engineering require a variety of data to be collected through different studies – focusing on a single context or single metric rarely tells a useful story. But, in each study, the requirements of the local context are liable to impose different constraints on study design, the metrics to be collected, and other factors. Thus, even when all the studies focus on the same phenomenon (say, software quality), such studies can validly collect a number of different measures that are not at all compatible (say, number of defects required to be fixed during development, number of problem reports received from the customer, total amount of effort that needed to be spent on rework). Can anything be done to build a useful body of knowledge from these disparate pieces? This chapter addresses strategies that have been applied to date to draw conclusions from across such varied but valid data sets. Key approaches are compared and the data to which they are best suited are identified. Our analysis together with associated lessons learned provide decision support for readers interested in choosing and using such approaches to build up useful theories.},
